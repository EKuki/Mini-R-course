*Reminder: Unfortunately, our video software failed a couple of times. If you follow the code and the slides you should be OK, though. In the video material we go through some extra details, q/a, live troubleshooting and everything you can think could go wrong on a live tutorial. Videos are slow, so feel free to increase the speed and remember to watch in HQ (check youtube options).*
