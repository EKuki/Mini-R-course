## Packages and Libraries

A **package** is a compilation of functions, data and documentation. They only need to be installed once (Reinstall only when updating R/RStudio). You will need to have internet connection to download it, as R downloads its packages from the web.

R comes with a standard set of packages which libraries donâ€™t need to be called (base R)

A **library** is a directory where packages are stored. Libraries need to "called" (typed in the script or console) at each R session (before using the functions it contains).
