Follow along with the [power point presentation](https://github.com/EKuki/website/blob/master/content/courses/new_r_and_sna/3.Map%20SNA%20ggplot_April19.pptx) corresponding to this `3. ggplot2` section. 

You also have a recording for this section; however, our recording software failed and you will only be able to follow the audio, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX7TrJWv7rE&t=8s).

*Reminder: Unfortunately, our video software failed a couple of times. If you follow the code and the slides you should be OK, though. In the video material we go through some extra details, q/a, live troubleshooting and everything you can think could go wrong on a live tutorial. Videos are slow, so feel free to increase the speed and remember to watch in HQ (check youtube options).*

**Learning objectives:**

* Learn the principal components of a ggplot object
* Use ggplot2 basic functions
* Create a base map and plot a network
