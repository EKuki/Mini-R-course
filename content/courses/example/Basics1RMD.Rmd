To write a comment, type `#` before the sentence you want to write.
Anything to the right of a `#` in a script will be ignored by R.

> To comment on a whole paragraph, select the lines you want to comment and press at the same time on your keyboard `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `c`.

> To run: Click anywhere on the line you want to run and either 1) Click `Ctr` + `Enter` or 2) Click on `run` bottom (up right corner of Source/Script)

> If you want to run several lines, highlight them all and do as explained above.

You can get output in the Console simply by typing math in the script and running it:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
3 + 5 # Result is 8
12/2 # Result is 6 
```
